Example DSL With Blocks
=======================

Start with the design we'd like to implement and a failing test for it.

Run the tests, and we get:

```bash
uninitialized constant Serializer (NameError)
```

I create a class named `Serializer`, include it in the tests' file, and run them
again. Now it yells:

```bash
undefined method `item' for UserSerializer:Class (NoMethodError)
```

The first thing we need to think about now is: do we need `#item` to be a class or an
instance method? Or both? In the tests we're using an instance method, so let's
start by writing this first.

```ruby
class Serializer
  def item
  end
end
```

Run the tests again, an we still get the exact same error message.

Ok, this _can't_ be accomplished. Go home and start thinking about opening a pub.
People love drinking. I could make good money on this.

Wait! The error message ends with `UserSerializer:Class`. I hadn't noticed this
`:Class`. Let's try moving `#item` to a class method:

```ruby
class Serializer
  def self.item
  end
end
```

Run the tests again, andâ€¦

```bash
undefined method `collection' for UserSerializer:Class (NoMethodError)
```

Yeah! We moved forward. Now let's do exactly the same for the `#collection`
method.

```ruby
class Serializer
  def self.item
  end

  def self.collection
  end
end
```

Run the tests again, and great!, we get completely different errors.
